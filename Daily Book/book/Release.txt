Feature good to have
- Search of word on the given bible book.
[
	* Use IndexedDB for data search process (on progress; input not accept text)
	* App read the already created indexeddb file (not possible)
	    * During init time, it creates indexedDb from given JSON on dedicated worker.
		* JSON data file is created beforehand that it is DB with key and value schema
		* Search: it searches from created indexedDB.

	* Search results are 100 max (done)
	* key: word; value: Reserved (2^8) Book (2^8)Chapter(2^8)Verse(2^8)
	     eg. 00 13 96 06 (Psalms, 150:6).
